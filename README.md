LibertAI Agents are highly customizable assistants that operates in a decentralized and confidential environment.\
They can be given tools to perform tasks (search something on the web, make a transaction on-chain...), making them
powerful companions.

> ðŸ’¡ Agents are currently in private beta, contact the team [on Telegram](https://t.me/libertai) if you
want to try it out!\
We are planning some improvements and will listen to beta tester's feedbacks before releasing a stable version.

This repository contains the source code of the actual [Python framework](https://pypi.org/project/libertai-agents) that you can use to create your agents, along with the backend used internally to manage their deployment on [Aleph.im](https://aleph.im)'s decentralized and confidential VMs.
